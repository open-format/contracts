# ðŸ“œ Open Format Contracts

**The main smart contracts used in the Open Format ecosystem**

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Installation

Install dependencies.

```
make install
```

Setup your environment variables.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Environment variable configuration

| Variable          | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`     | Private key of wallet for deploying and interacting with scripts                                               |
| `POLYGON_RPC_URL` | The POLYGON_RPC_URL is the endpoint for interacting with the Polygon blockchain network.                       |
| `APP_ID`          | Used in scripts that engage with a particular app. An App ID can be generated at https://apps.openformat.tech/ |

### Compile contracts

```
forge build
```

### Testing

```
forge test
```

### Formatting (vscode only)

To enable the built-in formatter that comes with Foundry to automatically format your code on save, you can add the following settings to your .vscode/settings.json:

```
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[solidity]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "JuanBlanco.solidity"
  },
  "solidity.formatter": "forge",
}
```

### Static Analyzers

[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.

```

```

[Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril) is a security analysis tool for EVM bytecode. It detects security vulnerabilities in smart contracts built for Ethereum, Hedera, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

```
myth analyze src/*
```

### Code Style Guide

#### Errors

Errors should be defined using [custom error syntax](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/) and follow the naming convention of `ContractName_errorDescriptionInCamelCase`.

for example:

```solidity
error ERC721LazyMint_insufficientLazyMintedTokens();
```

When testing the error, it's selector can be used:

```solidity
vm.expectRevert(ERC721LazyMint.ERC721LazyMint_insufficientLazyMintedTokens.selector);
```
